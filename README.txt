SELENE Device
3D graphics rendering framework

SELENE Device is intended to be cross-platform. Currently it has only windows renderer though, but core can be compiled under Linux with GCC-4.7.

Repository also contains Visual Studio 2010 solution and projects. In order to compile the Windows platform, VC+ Directory which contains direct3D 9 headers and libraries must be specified in project Windows.

See GUIDELINES.txt for programming guidlines.

The simple demos will be added soon.
