SELENE Device is a 3D graphics rendering engine. It is cross-platform, but currently it has only Windows renderer. Engine and Exporter can be compiled under Linux with GCC-4.6.3 and GNU Make 3.81.

This repository contains Visual Studio 2010 solution and projects. In order to compile the Windows platform, VC+ Directory which contains Direct3D 9 headers and libraries must be specified in project called "Windows".

Currently there are two demos availiable. To run them you should unzip the ApplicationData.zip archive (see Downloads) to the folder, which contains SELENE Device, for example:
        /home/user/SELENE-Device      <-- SELENE Device folder
        /home/user/ApplicationData    <-- folder, which contains application data
